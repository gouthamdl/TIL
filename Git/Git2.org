** Ignore local changes in tracked files
   There might be a situation where you want to change a file locally but do not want to push it to
   the remote repository and do not want the file showing up when doing git status. 
   This can be done with git update-index as shown below(taking .gitignore as the example file)
   #+begin_src sh
   git update-index --assume-unchanged .gitignore
   # To undo this
   git update-index --no-assume-unchanged .gitignore
   # To get the list of files ignored like this
   git ls-files -v | grep '^h' 
   #+end_src
   There are some limitations to this. Doing a stash and stash pop seems to restore the remote
   version of the file.
   Another option is skip-worktree which tries harder to preserve local changes. The corresponding commands:
   #+begin_src sh
   git update-index --skip-worktree .gitignore
   git update-index --no-skip-worktree .gitignore
   git ls-files -v | grep '^S' 
   # To undo this
