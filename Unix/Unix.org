*** Highlight grep matches
    #+begin_src sh
    # Add this to bash.rc to color grep matches red
    export GREP_OPTIONS='--color=auto' GREP_COLOR='1;37;41'
    #+end_src

*** Start a process in the background
    Say you'd like to run emacs in the current folder but in the background so that
    you can continue using the terminal. This can be done using '&' which runs a command in the background.
    #+begin_src sh
    emacs &
    #+end_src
    Use jobs to list the current background jobs, C-z to suspend them, fg to bring a job
    to the foreground and kill <job ID> to kill a bg process.
