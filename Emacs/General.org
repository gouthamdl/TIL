*** Open an Emacs file in the browser
    Use M-x browse-url-of-file.
    For org mode, Export the file as HTML (C-c C-e h o) and then open the html file.

*** Delete a file using Emacs
    Use M-x dired (Or C-x d) to open the dired buffer for the file. 
    Flag files to be deleted with 'd' and run actions with 'x'.

*** Remove text within quotes
    Zap to Char i.e M-z <char> deletes all characters upto and including <char>. 
    To do this in reverse, give a numeric prefix. For eg: C-u -1 M-z <char>
    M-2 M-z " will kill upto 2 instances of " and anything in between. Helpful when your current point is the beginning quote.
    Note that C-M-k (kill-sexp) does the same thing.
